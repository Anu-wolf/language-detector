# Language Detection Model
Project overview
This project implements a Language Detection Model using Naive Bayes Classification. The goal is to identify the language of a given input text based on patterns learned from a dataset containing text samples in different languages. The project uses scikit-learn for machine learning and CountVectorizer for converting text data into numerical format.
This project is a language detection system that can identify 22 languages based on input text. The model is trained on a dataset containing 1,000 lines per language, providing a solid foundation for accurate detection.

Features:
- Detects 22 different languages.
- Uses a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) for language prediction.
- Utilizes the Bag of Words (BoW) model to convert text into numerical features.
- Trained on a dataset with 1,000 lines of text per language.

Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For Numerical computing.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library (for CountVectorizer, Naive Bayes classifier, and data splitting).

Dataset
The dataset used for training contains text samples from 22 languages. Each language has 1,000 lines of text, making a balanced dataset. The dataset is publicly available and can be loaded from [this source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/dataset.csv).

How the Model Works
           1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using `pandas` and checked for any null values.
           2. Feature Extraction: Text data is transformed into numerical data using `CountVectorizer`, which implements a Bag of Words model.
            3. Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on the training data.
            4. Prediction: After training, the model is used to predict the language of new text inputs provided by the user.
Applications
1.	Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Identify user input language and provide responses accordingly or suggest translations.
2.	Content Management Systems (CMS)
Detect content language to categorize posts or auto-translate.
3.	E-commerce Websites
Provide language-specific product suggestions or regional customer service support.
4.	Search Engines
Tailor search results based on the user’s language input.
5.	Language Learning Apps
Offer practice exercises or detect proficiency in different languages.


Future Improvements
Expanding the dataset to include more languages and larger text.
Improving accuracy by using advanced models like Neural Networks.
Implementing a web interface for ease of user.
Improve model accuracy with more diverse datasets.
Add support for detecting multiple languages in a single input (e.g., code-switching).
Integrate with translation APIs to offer translation services.

Integration into a Web Project
To integrate this model into a web application, follow these steps:
1.	Export the Trained Model
After training the model, save it as a serialized file (pickle format) to be loaded in the web backend
2.	Create a Web Backend with Flask
Install Flask 
Create a server.py file to load the model and serve predictions through a web API
3.	Frontend Integration
In the frontend(HTML/JavaScript), make an AJAX call to the predict API
4.	Run the Web Application
Run the Flask Server with:
“python server.py”
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the web interface.
